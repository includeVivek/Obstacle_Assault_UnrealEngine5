I have created a captivating game project using Unreal Engine 5 and implemented object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++. This project is inspired by the popular game "Stumble Guys" and aims to deliver an equally enjoyable and challenging gaming experience.

In this game, players embark on a hilarious and action-packed journey through various obstacle courses and challenges. The project utilizes Unreal Engine 5's cutting-edge graphical capabilities to render stunning visuals and create immersive environments. The OOP approach in C++ ensures clean code architecture, making it easier to manage and extend the game's functionality.

The game features a diverse range of characters, each with their unique abilities and appearances, adding depth and variety to the gameplay. Players compete against each other or AI-controlled opponents in a series of races, navigating through tricky obstacles, jumps, slides, and puzzles. The physics-based interactions within the game make the experience more dynamic and realistic.

I have implemented multiplayer functionality, allowing players to connect and compete with their friends online, enhancing the game's social aspect. Furthermore, the project includes a comprehensive UI system, ensuring seamless navigation, player feedback, and an intuitive user experience.

To enhance the replay value, the game incorporates a progression system, rewarding players with unlocks, achievements, and customization options as they advance through the levels. This encourages players to keep playing and striving for new goals.

Overall, this Unreal Engine 5 project showcases my skills in C++ and OOP principles while delivering an entertaining and visually stunning gaming experience inspired by "Stumble Guys."
